# Cars-Models

## Overview

This repository provides tools and scripts for analyzing and visualizing car models data. The project focuses on extracting insights and patterns from datasets related to car models and their features, leveraging Python-based data analysis and visualization techniques.

## Features

- Data preprocessing for car models datasets.
- Visualization of car features, including trends and distributions.
- Exporting cleaned and processed data for further use in other projects.

## Project Structure

- **`scripts/`**: Contains Python scripts for data preprocessing and visualization.
- **`data/`**: Placeholder for raw datasets used in the project.
- **`output/`**: Stores processed data and generated visualizations.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for data handling and analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For creating visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: To document and demonstrate analysis steps.
